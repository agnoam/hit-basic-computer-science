Check the provided code below, suggest code optimizations, and search for possible logical bugs. Ignore the `main()`, all marked "black-box" and "utils" function implementations, and input validation checks in your review.

Function implementation constraints:
1. For `findCommonDigit` function, you can assume that the digits are always sorted in acending order from left to right.
2. For `moveDuplicatesV1` and `moveDuplicatesV2` functions, the implementation should not be recursive. 
    1. In `moveDuplicatesV1` you can assume that the array elements are integers within the range of `-n` to `n` and should run at runtime complexity of $O(n)$. 
    2. In `moveDuplicatesV2` you can assume that all of the numbers are positive integers. and the runtime complexity of $O(n*log(n))$.
3. In `validateArray` function the runtime complexity should be $O(n)$ and the implementation should be non-recursive.

Consider the constraints while reviewing the code below.
After the code review write a table with all of your suggestions that describes shortly your thoughts.
